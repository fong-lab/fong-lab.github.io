# Harnessing plasticity for lifelong learning and rehabilitation

The Fong Lab seeks to understand how activity and experience shape neural circuits, and to develop plasticity-based technologies for treating neurological disorders. Toward this goal, we use a variety of approaches including electrophysiology, optogenetics, behavior, modeling, and control systems engineering. Current work focuses on the central visual pathway and neurodevelopmental visual impairment. Our research benefits from synergistic interactions between life scientists, engineers, educators, and clinicians.
