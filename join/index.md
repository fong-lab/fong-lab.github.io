# Ongoing Opportunities

<!--### Staff Positions
Technician positions open up every 1-2 years.  If you are interested in learning about future opportunities or anticipated hiring timelines, please send an inquiry to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).-->

### Postdoctoral scholars
Funding for various postdoctoral opportunities is available on a rolling basis.  If you are interested our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).  We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in acute brain slice or retinal electrophysiology, so if you fit this description please be sure to mention it in your inquiry.

### Doctoral students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to one of the following programs: 

[Georgia Tech and Emory Joint Biomedical Engineering Program](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/georgia-tech-emory-bme-phd-program) <br>
[Emory Neuroscience Program](https://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/NS/) <br>
[Georgia Tech Bioengineering Program](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu/) <br>
[Georgia Tech Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Program](https://neuro.gatech.edu/training-page/graduate-academic-programs/phd/)<br>
[Emory MD-PhD Program](https://med.emory.edu/MDPHD/)

**We cannot directly admit graduate students into our lab.** However, if you are interested in our research, we encourage you to apply to one (or more) of the programs above.  On your application, you can list our lab as one that interests you.  If you are invited for an interview, please reach out and we will try our best to be placed on your interview schedule.  If you are offered admission and want to learn specific details about ongoing projects or joining the lab for your PhD studies (or a research rotation), please contact [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

### Undergraduate students
If you are a Georgia Tech student interested in working in the lab, please fill out the [Undergraduate Research Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/r/QD7qYbh2Et).  We encourage you to fill out this form (rather than to email us directly) to demonstrate that you have read through our website and understand the expectations for undergraduate researchers in our lab.  When positions become available, lab personnel will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with their research projects.  At that time, they will reach out to candidates directly to request additional materials (e.g. resume) and schedule interviews.  This communication typically occurs 1-2 months prior to the start of the semester, with hiring occuring at the beginning of the semester.

If you are an undergraduate student interested in a fellowship or summer internship, we accept students from many different programs.  Some examples include:

[Georgia Tech SURE](https://sure.gatech.edu/)  (undergraduates from any university)<br>
[Georgia Tech ESTEEMED](https://esteemed.bme.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Tech undergraduates)<br>
[Georgia Tech Neuroscience REU](https://reu.neuroscience.gatech.edu/) (undergraduates from any university)<br>
[Emory Ophthalmology SEE Program](https://med.emory.edu/departments/ophthalmology/ophthalmic-education/medical-student-education.html) (undergraduates or 1st/2nd year medical students)<br>
[Georgia Tech Petit Scholars Program](https://research.gatech.edu/bio/petit-undergraduate-research-scholars-program) (Georgia Tech undergraduates) <br>
[Emory LGS-SOAR Program](https://gs.emory.edu/diversity/programming/lgs-soar/index.html) (non-Emory undergraduates)<br>

If you are interested in our research but applying to another undergraduate research program based at Georgia Tech or Emory, feel free to contact us and we can determine if we are eligible to take accept student from that program.

### High school students
We accept high school students into our lab who are part of one of the following programs:

[Georgia Tech Project ENGAGES](https://projectengages.gatech.edu) <br>
[Emory Next Gen Scholars](https://med.emory.edu/departments/human-genetics/next-gen.html) <br>
[Cristo Rey Atlanta Corporate Work-Study Program](https://www.cristoreyatlanta.org/work-study/program-overview) <br>

**We cannot accept high school students into our lab unless they are part of an official program at Georgia Tech or Emory.**  If you are interested in our research, we encourage you to apply to one of the programs and request our lab as one that interests you.  If you are applying for a different summer internship or work-study program that has an existing partnership with Georgia Tech or Emory, feel free to contact that program to ask whether our lab would be eligible to participate.
