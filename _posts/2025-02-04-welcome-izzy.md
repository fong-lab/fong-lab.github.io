We are excited to welcome Isabelle Witteven-Patel to the Fong Lab for a research rotation.  Izzy is a first-year PhD student in the Neuroscience Program at Emory University.  She is interested in cellular physiology in the context of sensory plasticity, and comes to the lab with expertise using electrophysiology to study in cellular and circuit properties in the visual and auditory systems. During her rotation, she will be investigating how ocular dominance plasticity impacts the ON and OFF visual pathways.  Welcome, Izzy!
