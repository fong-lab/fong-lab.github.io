We are pleased to welcome Audrey Garlick to the Fong Lab! Audrey is a first-year undergraduate studying Neuroscience at Georgia Tech with broad interests in learning, plasticity, and neurological disease. She is particularly interested in neurodegenerative disorders and hopes to pursue an MD-PhD in the future. In the lab, Audrey will study how optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits drives thalamocortical plasticity in mice under the mentorship of PhD candidate Yichao Zhao. Welcome, Audrey!
