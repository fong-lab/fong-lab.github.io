We are happy to welcome Elijah Lapeza to the Fong Lab for a research rotation. Eli is a first-year PhD student in GT-Emory Biomedical Engineering Program and a fellow in the NIBIB T32 Computational Neural Engineering Training Program. Eli is interested in neural plasticity and rehabilitation, and joins the lab to work on projects related to how early life experiences shapes neural responses in the mature mammalian visual system.  Welcome, Eli!
