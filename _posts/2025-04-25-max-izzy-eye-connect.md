Izzy and Max presented posters on their rotation projects at the Eye Connect Symposium at Emory.  Izzy presented her work on asymmetric impacts of ocular dominance plasticity on the ON and OFF pathways.  Max presented his work on the reliability and precision of optogenetic thalamic stimulation on visual cortical activation.  The new findings they produced in just 2 months was impressive!  Special thanks to Chao, Morgan, and Adam for providing mentorship and contributing data to these presentations.
