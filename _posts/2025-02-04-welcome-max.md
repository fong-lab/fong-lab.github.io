We are delighted to welcome Xinyuan (Max) Cao to the Fong Lab for a research rotation. Max is a PhD student in Neuroscience at Emory University who is broadly interested in sensory and social neuroscience.  He joins the lab with research experience using machine learning to undercover hormonal interactions in the brains of monogamous rodents. During his rotation, he will be investigating how varied patterns of stimulation in the mouse lateral geniculate nucleus impact physiology in thalamocortical and intracortical circuits.  Welcome, Max!
