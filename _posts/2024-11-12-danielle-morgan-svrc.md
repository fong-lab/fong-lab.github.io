Danielle and Morgan each presented posters at the Southeast Vision Research Conference in Nashville.  Danielle presented her modeling work on global and input-specific synaptic scaling, and Morgan presented her experimental work on inactivation of the retinal ON pathway.  Rob Lamprecht provided key data that laid the foundation for both studies.
