We are happy to welcome Aanchal Acharya to the Fong Lab! Aanchal is a first year Neuroscience undergraduate at Georgia Tech. She plans to pursue medical school and hopes to become a neurosurgeon focused on treating neurological disorders and reducing stigma around neurodivergence. She will be conducting research with Max on studying how temporary visual deprivation affects auditory and visual cortical plasticity in adult mice. Welcome Aanchal!
