As the summer ends, we say goodbye to two lab members.  Ta'Kayla is transferring to Georgia Southern University to pursue her passion in audiology through a degree program in Communication Sciences and Disorders.  Arvin completed his rotation and will be joining the Birey lab to pursue research in neural development using assembloid models.  We're grateful for their contributions during a "critical period" for the lab.  We look forward to following their careers!
