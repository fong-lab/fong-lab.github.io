Nahreen, Chao, Danielle, Adam, and Ming returned for a third year to volunteer at the Southeast Regional National Qualifier goalball tournament to set up the nets, lines, and assist with judging/scorekeeping.  We love the Georgia Blind Sports community, and nothing beats having front row seats to live athletic entertainment!
