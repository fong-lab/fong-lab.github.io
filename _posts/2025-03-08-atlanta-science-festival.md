Nahreen Shamon Ayala and Trinity Calvin gave a demonstration on visual illusions at Atlanta Science Festival!  They used the illusions to teach neuroscience and engineering concepts to children and their families, and distributed goodies for attendees to bring home.  We are proud to have them representing the Fong lab and using vision science to teach/promote STEM in our community.
