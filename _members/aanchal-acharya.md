Aanchal Acharya is an undergraduate majoring in Neuroscience at Georgia Tech. She is working as an undergraduate research assistant examining how temporary visual deprivation affects auditory and visual cortical plasticity in adult mice. She is interested in exploring the biological mechanisms of neurological disorders and investigating treatment options that harness the power of the brain’s plasticity. She aspires to attend medical school and hopes to become a neurosurgeon, helping treat neurological disorders in a clinical setting and raising awareness of neurological disorders to combat stigmatization against neurodivergent individuals.
