Alissa Klein is a Biomedical Engineering major at Georgia Tech and will be starting her fourth year in the fall.  She is working in the Fong lab as part of the Emory Ophthalmology SEED Internship Program and conducting research on mouse models of amblyopia. She previously has done glaucoma research in the Feola lab at Emory University, where she gained experience working with rats for OCT imaging and helped with CAD/3D printing. In a more general sense, she hopes to get her masters and go to medical school. Alissa aspires to love to work on the medical side of translational medicine using both engineering and medical knowledge to help implement new devices/procedures.
