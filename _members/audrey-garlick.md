Audrey Garlick is a first-year undergraduate student studying Neuroscience at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She is broadly interested in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying learning, plasticity, and disease, with a particular focus on neurodegenerative disorders. Audrey hopes to pursue an MD-PhD in the future, with the goal of integrating clinical practice and translational neuroscience research to better understand and treat neurological disease. In the Fong Lab, Audrey investigates how optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits can drive thalamocortical plasticity in a mouse model under the mentorship of PhD candidate Yichao Zhao.
